# 6502_assembly_Demo_OS
Operating system written in 6502 assembly and tested on 6502 emulators.

Can be compiled and run on the following emulators :

  A. online

    * https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/
    * http://www.6502asm.com/

Will be tested on more emulators in the future. 6502 standards are pretty old and uniform, so it should work on most emulators.

If you find compatibility issues with any emulators, please let me know ...
